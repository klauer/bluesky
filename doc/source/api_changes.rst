API Changes
===========


v0.3.0
------

* Removed ``RunEngine.persistent_fields``; all fields in ``RE.md`` persist
  between runs by default.
* No metadata fields are "reserved"; any can be overwritten by the user.
* No metadata fields are absolutely required. The metadata validation function
  is user-customizable. The default validation function behaves the same
  as previous versions of bluesky, but it is no longer manditory.
* The signature of ``RunEngine`` has changed. The ``logbook`` argument is now
  keyword-only, and there is a new keyword-only argument, ``md_validator``.
  See docstring for details.
* The ``configure`` method on readable objects now takes a single optional
  argument, a dictionary that the object can use to configure itself however
  it sees fit. The ``configure`` method always has a new return value, a tuple
  of dicts describing its old and new states:
  ``old, new = obj.configure(state)``
* Removed method ``increment_scan_id``
* `broker_callbacks.post_run` API and docstring brought into agreement.
  The API is change to expect a callable with signature
  ``foo(doc_name, doc)`` rather than:
    - a callable which takes a document (as documented)
    - an object with ``start``, ``descriptor``, ``event`` and ``stop``
      methods (as implemented).

  If classes derived from `CallbackBase` are being used this will not
  not have any effect on user code.

v0.5.0
------


* The (not widely used) ``Center`` plan has been removed. It may be
  distributed separately in the future.
* Calling a "SPEC-like" plan now returns a generator that must be passed
  to the RunEngine; it does not execute the plan with the global RunEngine in
  gs.RE. There is a convenience wrapper available to restore the old behavior
  as desired. But since that usage renders the plans un-composable, it is
  discouraged.
* The 'time' argument of the SPEC-like plans is a keyword-only argument.
* The following special-case SPEC-like scans have been removed:
    * hscan
    * kscan
    * lscan
    * tscan
    * dtscan 
    * hklscan 
    * hklmesh
  They can be defined in configuration files as desired, and in that location
  they will be easier to customize.
